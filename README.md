# Lab 3 - React Notes

## Assignment
For this lab, I used React and Google Firebase to build a collaborative post-it note web app. Users can add notes, delete notes, edit the content in markdown, and drag the notes to different sections of the screen. These changes are all reflected in a Firebase database, so users will see others' changes to the notes in real time.

## Structure
I began with my starterpack from short assignment three then organized the rest of my code into `src` and `services`. 

Immutable.js, draggable, textareaautosize...
